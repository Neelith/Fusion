# Fusion

This console app is designed to help with file management and system cleaning. Version 1.0 has the ability to:
- Merge file text (it only support text based files, no excel or pdf merging is available yet).
- Delete files based on parameters and configurations.
- Schedule previous commands so that only one command is launched.

Run 'Fusion.exe -h' in your cli for more details.

Enjoy!
